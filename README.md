#Project Title: Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard:
The project aims to analyze historical stock and revenue data by using yfinance to extract stock data for Tesla and GameStop, and webscraping to extract revenue data for both companies. The data will be used to plot stock graphs and build a dashboard for visualizing the findings.


#Description:
The project focuses on analyzing historical stock and revenue data of two companies, Tesla and GameStop (GME), and building a dashboard to visualize and interpret the data. The primary tools utilized in this project are Python, yfinance library for extracting stock data, and webscraping techniques for gathering revenue data.

#The project workflow is as follows:

#Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data:
The yfinance library is employed to retrieve historical stock data for Tesla and GameStop. This data includes information such as opening and closing prices, high and low prices, trading volume, and date.

#Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data:
Webscraping techniques are utilized to extract revenue data specifically for Tesla. By scraping relevant financial websites or Tesla's investor relations page, the project collects revenue data over a specific time period.

#Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data:
Similar to step 1, the yfinance library is used again to retrieve additional stock data for Tesla, such as stock splits, dividends, and any other relevant information.

#Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data:
Webscraping techniques are employed once more, this time to extract revenue data for GameStop. The project scrapes financial websites or GameStop's investor relations page to gather the revenue data.

#Plot Tesla Stock Graph:
The project employs data visualization techniques to plot a graph of Tesla's historical stock performance. This graph provides a visual representation of the stock's trends, including price fluctuations, volume, and any other relevant data.

#Plot GameStop Stock Graph:
Similar to step 5, the project plots a graph of GameStop's historical stock performance. This graph allows for a comparative analysis of the two companies' stocks, enabling insights into their respective performances.

The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a dashboard that showcases the extracted data and graphs in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The dashboard allows users to explore and analyze the historical stock and revenue data of Tesla and GameStop, gaining insights into their financial performances over time.

By contributing this project to open source, the aim is to provide a valuable resource for individuals interested in analyzing stock and revenue data, conducting comparative studies between different companies, or studying the financial market trends. The project's open-source nature encourages collaboration, improvements, and customization based on the users' specific requirements.

Overall, this project offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing historical stock and revenue data, empowering users with the tools to make informed decisions and gain deeper insights into the financial performance of Tesla and GameStop.
